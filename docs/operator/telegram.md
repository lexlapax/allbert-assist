# Telegram operator guide

v0.12.1 makes the Telegram pilot more channel-native while keeping the daemon and kernel as the source of truth.

## Setup

Enable Telegram through the daemon channel command:

```bash
cargo run -p allbert-cli -- daemon channels add telegram
cargo run -p allbert-cli -- daemon channels status telegram
```

The channel requires a bot token and at least one allowlisted chat. Secrets stay under `~/.allbert/secrets/`; the allowlist lives under `~/.allbert/config/`.

## Commands

Telegram supports compact operator commands:

```text
/status
/activity
/approve <approval-id>
/reject <approval-id>
/override <reason>
/reset
```

`/status` reports the channel/runtime posture. `/activity` renders the daemon-owned `ActivitySnapshot`, including current phase, elapsed time, bounded tool summary, stuck hint, and next action when available.

## Approvals

Telegram approval prompts include the same bounded approval context as TUI, REPL, and CLI. Patch approvals may show a short diff preview, but full patch artifacts remain session-backed and install remains a separate explicit command.

Accepting an approval records review only. If a patch approval is accepted, Allbert still requires a later `self-improvement install <approval-id>` command from a local operator surface.

## Errors

Telegram turn failures append the same remediation hints as local surfaces where possible. Common examples include missing bot token, allowlist mismatch, daemon activity, provider key, cost-cap, and approval expiry guidance.
