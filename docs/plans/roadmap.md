# Allbert Roadmap

This roadmap is the running planning index for Allbert. The long-term vision is
captured in `docs/plans/allbert-jido-vision.md`; implementation-ready milestone
plans live alongside this file. Identified but unassigned future work lives in
`docs/plans/future-features.md`.

## Vision

Allbert is a personal assistant runtime that grows with its user. The core
direction is Elixir/OTP plus Jido: supervised processes, signal-driven
coordination, Jido agents for intent and delegation, Jido actions for validated
capabilities, and markdown-first memory that remains inspectable and portable.

Status: vision drafted.

## v0.01: First Local Assistant Loop

Plan: `docs/plans/v0.01-plan.md`
Request flow: `docs/plans/v0.01-request-flow.md`

Status: complete. Milestones 1 and 2 are complete and tested; Milestone 3 is
complete, tested, and operator-verified; Milestone 4 is complete, tested, and
operator-verified; Milestones 5, 5.1, 6, and 7 are complete and tested.

Summary:

- Clean the formatter/precommit baseline. Complete.
- Introduce a signal-first runtime boundary. Complete.
- Add the first primary intent agent. Complete.
- Add explicit Jido actions and a permission gate. Complete.
- Add markdown memory v0. Complete.
- Add deterministic personal preference heuristics. Complete.
- Record traces and basic cost/diagnostic metadata. Complete.
- Expose the same loop through CLI/REPL and Phoenix LiveView. Complete.

Current operator loop:

- `AllbertAssist.Runtime.submit_user_input/1` accepts local user input and
  emits `allbert.input.received` / `allbert.agent.responded` log signals.
- The default runtime path uses `AllbertAssist.Agents.IntentAgent` with a
  deterministic v0.01 action surface for direct answers, memory intent
  selection, skill inspection, and inert shell-command planning.
- `AllbertAssist.Security.PermissionGate` records explicit permission decisions
  for read-only work, memory-write intent, command planning, blocked command
  execution, and external network confirmation.
- `AllbertAssist.Memory` stores explicit memories as user-readable markdown.
  v0.01 used `ALLBERT_MEMORY_ROOT` or `var/allbert/memory`; v0.02 supersedes
  that default with `<ALLBERT_HOME>/memory` while preserving temp root
  overrides for tests and operator escape hatches.
- Basic identity and preference statements, such as "my name is Sandeep" and
  "I prefer short updates", flow through the same markdown memory path with
  conservative heuristics.
- When tracing is enabled, runtime turns write inspectable markdown traces under
  the memory `traces` category and return the trace path in `response.trace_id`.
- `mix allbert.ask` provides the first terminal entrypoint over the same runtime
  core.
- The `/agent` LiveView uses the same runtime boundary and displays the
  response, status, signal id, and trace path when available.

Exit signal: Allbert can remember something, recall recent memory, explain or
select a safe action, and leave an inspectable trace from both CLI and web UI.

Next milestone: v0.02 Allbert Home, Settings Central, Secrets, And Operator
Profile.

## Dependency Reassessment After v0.01

The origin and vision both point at the same growth path: a small kernel first,
then operator settings, inspectable skills and actions, confirmations, jobs,
channels, memory curation, and only later richer intent or more autonomous
execution.

v0.01 completed the first kernel slice. The important remaining foundation is
not more UI, embeddings, or command execution. The next missing layer is a
canonical Allbert home, a settings engine, and then skills compatibility plus
durable capability contracts:

- where durable local runtime data lives
- which settings exist, who changed them, and which layer supplied them
- which user-supplied provider credentials are configured, without exposing
  raw secret values
- which provider/model profiles exist
- which skills exist
- where they came from and whether the source is trusted
- what `SKILL.md` instructions and bundled resources they expose
- which Allbert/Jido actions they are allowed to invoke, if any
- which permissions those actions require
- which confirmations are needed
- what memory and trace effects they produce
- how those capabilities appear to the intent agent, CLI, LiveView, jobs, and
  future channels

That contract should come before scheduled jobs, richer automation, external
network access, shell execution, or autonomous skill creation. Otherwise those
features will each invent their own private capability rules.

Dependency order from here:

1. Allbert Home plus Settings Central, secrets, provider/model profiles, and
   operator profile.
2. Agent Skills-compatible parsing, discovery, trust, and activation.
3. Action-backed Allbert skills and capability translation.
4. Confirmation workflow for sensitive capabilities.
5. Scheduled jobs that emit signals into the same runtime.
6. Additional channels that translate messages into the same runtime.
7. Memory review, summarization, and retrieval improvements.
8. Intent engine enrichment over real skills, actions, permissions, jobs,
   channels, and memory behavior.
9. Real external adapters, shell execution, scripting, and autonomous skill
   creation after the permission and trace story is sturdy.

`config.exs` remains deployment and boot configuration. It should not become
the user/operator settings surface. `ALLBERT_HOME` is bootstrap configuration:
the local root for settings, encrypted secrets, memory, database files, user
skills, caches, and temporary runtime data. Allbert needs a domain settings
engine that can be read and changed through CLI, LiveView, future channels, and
traces. The current runtime dependency set is almost enough, but direct YAML
parse/write dependencies are reasonable v0.02 dependencies if settings use
YAML; v0.03 will need YAML parsing for Agent Skills frontmatter anyway. Jido
remains the right substrate, `Req` remains the preferred HTTP client once
network adapters arrive, and no scripting dependency should be added yet.

## v0.02: Allbert Home, Settings Central, Secrets, And Operator Profile

Plan: `docs/plans/v0.02-plan.md`
Request flow: `docs/plans/v0.02-request-flow.md`

Status: complete.

Expected direction:

- Add `AllbertAssist.Paths` and make `ALLBERT_HOME` the canonical local root,
  defaulting to `~/.allbert` with `ALLBERT_HOME_DIR` as an accepted alias.
- Store settings, encrypted secrets, memory, local database, user skills,
  imported caches, and temporary runtime data under Allbert Home by default.
- Add a typed, file-backed settings subsystem for user/operator domain
  settings.
- Keep deployment config in `config.exs` and environment variables.
- Store user-supplied API keys through the Settings Central secret store,
  encrypted at rest and redacted everywhere they are displayed.
- Add layered settings resolution: defaults, deployment overrides, operator,
  project, channel, and request/session.
- Add settings namespaces for operator profile, runtime, providers, model
  profiles, skills, permissions, channels, jobs, and memory policy.
- Expose settings through runtime actions plus CLI and LiveView surfaces.
- Validate and audit settings writes.

Exit signal: Allbert has one local home directory and one operator-facing
settings center that can be used by CLI, LiveView, future channels, skill
trust, confirmation policy, jobs, and memory review without scattering paths or
settings across subsystems.

## v0.03: Agent Skills Substrate

Plan: `docs/plans/v0.03-plan.md`
Request flow: `docs/plans/v0.03-request-flow.md`

Status: in progress. Milestones 1 through 5 are complete and tested.
Milestone 6, operator loop and documentation closeout, is next.

Expected direction:

- Adopt the open Agent Skills `SKILL.md` folder format as Allbert's external
  and native skill authoring format.
- Add the substrate that parses standard skills into internal skill records,
  activation context, trust state, resource inventories, and diagnostics.
- Load built-in, project, user, and imported skills from predictable
  Agent-Skills-compatible directories.
- Route list/read/activate skill behavior through the registry instead of the
  current static in-code list.
- Use a dedicated `activate_skill` action/tool so Allbert can enforce trust,
  wrap instructions, list resources, and trace activation.
- Keep bundled scripts and external package installation non-executable in
  v0.03; they may be inspected, planned, and traced, but not run.
- Parse Allbert-specific metadata as inert contract data, but do not yet use it
  to drive action execution.

Current implementation:

- `AllbertAssist.Skills.Parser` parses standard Agent Skill directories with
  `SKILL.md` YAML frontmatter and markdown bodies.
- `AllbertAssist.Skills.AgentSkillSpec` stores parsed manifests, optional
  metadata, body text, external fields, diagnostics, and inert resource
  inventory.
- `AllbertAssist.Skills.Resource` inventories files under `scripts/`,
  `references/`, and `assets/` without execution.
- Parser tests cover valid standard skills, Allbert metadata, invalid YAML,
  missing required fields, duplicate names, resources, and scripts.
- `AllbertAssist.Skills.Registry` discovers bounded skill directories, applies
  trust and enablement policy, resolves duplicates, reserves built-in names,
  and reports skipped declarations through diagnostics.
- `AllbertAssist.Skills.Skill` and
  `AllbertAssist.Skills.CapabilityContract` represent normalized skill records
  and inert Allbert metadata contracts.
- Settings Central now validates and writes `skills.scan_paths`,
  `skills.trusted_project_roots`, `skills.enabled`, `skills.disabled`, and
  `skills.imported_cache_policy`.
- `list_skills` and `read_skill` use the registry.
- Built-in skill wrappers now live under `apps/allbert_assist/priv/skills/`
  as standard `SKILL.md` declarations with inert Allbert metadata. The
  temporary `:built_in_legacy` bridge remains only as a defensive fallback when
  no built-in declarations are packaged.
- `activate_skill` loads trusted skill instructions through progressive
  disclosure, returns resource inventory metadata, preserves inert capability
  contracts, and refuses missing or hidden skills with a structured not-found
  response.
- Traces now render selected skill metadata explicitly in the runtime turn
  header and in a dedicated `## Skill Metadata` section.

Exit signal: Allbert can discover standard Agent Skills, activate their
instructions through progressive disclosure, show source/trust/diagnostics, and
trace skill activation without granting any new unsafe capability.

## v0.04: Action-Backed Allbert Skills

Plan: `docs/plans/v0.04-plan.md`

Status: placeholder.

Expected direction:

- Translate Allbert metadata overlays into capability contracts.
- Map capability skills only to known Jido actions and known permission
  classes.
- Treat built-in Allbert skills as standard `SKILL.md` wrappers around
  registered Elixir/Jido actions; do not auto-convert skill files or scripts
  into executable modules.
- Add an action lifecycle runner that emits `allbert.action.requested` and
  `allbert.action.completed`.
- Wire action-backed built-in skills through the current conservative intent
  routing while preserving v0.01 safety behavior.
- Add the first Allbert skill creation/validation workflow for standard
  `SKILL.md` directories.

Exit signal: Allbert can explain, activate, and run action-backed built-in
skills through registered Jido actions with permission decisions and trace
metadata, while still refusing or deferring unsafe execution.

## v0.05: Confirmation Workflow

Plan: `docs/plans/v0.05-plan.md`

Status: placeholder.

Expected direction:

- Add pending capability requests for actions that require confirmation.
- Let CLI and LiveView approve or deny a pending request through the same
  runtime boundary.
- Use settings-backed permission defaults and confirmation preferences.
- Persist confirmation decisions in traces and memory-friendly audit records.
- Keep command execution and external network adapters inert until this flow is
  tested end-to-end.

## v0.06: Scheduled Jobs

Plan: `docs/plans/v0.06-plan.md`

Status: placeholder.

Expected direction:

- Add cron-like jobs that emit signals into the same runtime.
- Start with registry health checks, trace summaries, and low-risk daily
  briefs.
- Use settings for timezone, active/paused state, and schedule policy.
- Keep scheduled jobs observable through traces and registered skills/actions.

## v0.07: Additional Channels

Plan: `docs/plans/v0.07-plan.md`

Status: placeholder.

Expected direction:

- Add channel adapters after CLI and LiveView share the same runtime core.
- Candidate channels include email, SMS, Discord/Telegram-style chat, browser
  capture, and native UI surfaces.
- Channels translate external messages to signals and render responses; they do
  not own agent logic.
- Channels read and update shared settings through the settings engine.

## v0.08: Memory Review And Retrieval

Plan: `docs/plans/v0.08-plan.md`

Status: placeholder.

Expected direction:

- Add memory review, correction, promotion, and pruning workflows.
- Add summaries and compiled runtime views over markdown memory.
- Introduce embeddings or retrieval only after the markdown source of truth and
  review path are stable across CLI, LiveView, scheduled jobs, and additional
  channels.
- Use settings for memory review cadence, sensitivity policy, and promotion
  preferences.

## v0.09: Intent Engine Enrichment

Plan: `docs/plans/v0.09-plan.md`

Status: placeholder.

Expected direction:

- Introduce a structured intent decision contract with selected intent,
  confidence, candidate skills/actions, permission class, confirmation need,
  and diagnostics.
- Move beyond one-off route predicates into a hybrid deterministic and
  model-assisted intent engine that remains testable.
- Use settings, skill registry, action-backed skill contracts, confirmation
  history, jobs, channels, and memory review signals as routing inputs.
- Add intent traces and eval fixtures for activation, non-activation,
  permission, channel, job, memory, and refusal cases.
- Keep execution behind the existing action runner and permission gate.

Exit signal: Allbert can explain why it selected a skill/action/job/channel
path or declined to select one, expose alternatives and confidence, and produce
stable intent traces across real runtime surfaces without adding new side
effects.

## Future: Distillation And Self-Improvement

Status: research.

Expected direction:

- Explore small-model memory/personality distillation after memory and traces
  are trustworthy.
- Explore scripting or self-modification only after the action permission model
  is robust.
- Keep all self-improvement paths reviewable, reversible, and traceable.
